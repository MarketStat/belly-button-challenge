# belly-button-challenge

**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to use JavaScript and D3 to analyze different samples belly button information such as OTUs and provide graphs that provide a visual representation of the data.

**Note**

ChatGPT was used to troubleshoot and recommended adding error handling. I also used Plotly documentation as well as various StackOverflow forums regarding JavaScript as well as class materials.
